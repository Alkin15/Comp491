    <string name="boardingDesc1">\nLayer Zero App is a self reflection
tool that encourages you to
fill reflection logs.\n\n

Reflection logs are  mini surveys
with open ended questions.\n\n

They are designed to make you
think deeper on your experience
of sharing on social media. </string>
    <string name="boardingDesc2">\nThe first question of the
reflection log asks you for a
brief description of the experience.\n\n

Think of it like a journal.
Write down whatever you like.
Just share your thoughts either on
the experience of sharing or
experience of the content.</string>
    <string name="boarding_desc3">\nFollowing, reflection log includes
questions for three different aspects
of the experience you just described:
sensory, emotional, intellectual.\n\n

Here is a place for you to think deeper.
Take a breath. Take a new perspective.</string>
    <string name="sensoryDesc">\nThink about your experience from
a sensory perspective.
Rate the effect of sensory input on
your experience and add your comments.\n\n

Think about not just  what you saw, but also
about what you heard, touched, smelt,
and tasted.</string>
    <string name="emotionalDesc">\nThink about your experience from
an emotional perspective.
Rate the effect of emotional input on
your experience and add your comments.\n\n

Think about your feelings, dig  even deeper.</string>
    <string name="intellectualDesc">
        \nThink about your experience
from an intellectual perspective.
Rate the effect of intellectual input on
your experience and add your comments..\n\n
